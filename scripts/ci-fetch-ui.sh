#!/usr/bin/env bash
# CI-only: fetches @get-enlace/ui (from GitHub Packages or public npmjs.org)
# and copies its dist/ output into a given package's src/<import_pkg>/ui_embedded/
# — no npm or Node needed, since a published npm package is just a gzipped
# tarball at an HTTP URL (plain curl + tar). Local development uses
# scripts/dev-sync-ui.sh instead, which builds from a checkout.
#
# Generalized over packages/* — see dev-sync-ui.sh's header for why.
#
# Requires GITHUB_TOKEN in the environment when fetching from GitHub Packages
# (packages:read is enough — GitHub Packages requires auth even for public
# reads). Not needed, and not sent, when fetching from public npmjs.org.
#
# Usage: scripts/ci-fetch-ui.sh <package-dir> <dist-tag-or-version> [registry-url]
#   package-dir is a directory name under packages/, e.g. enlace-fastapi.
#   A bare tag like "dev" resolves to whatever version currently holds it —
#   only meaningful the first time in a release, to pick a build to ship.
#   An exact version (e.g. "0.0.1-dev.123") is pinned as-is, no resolution —
#   use this to re-fetch the identical bytes an earlier step already chose,
#   since a floating tag can move between a dev publish and its paired prod
#   promotion (which may sit behind a manual approval gate for a while).
#   registry-url defaults to GitHub Packages (the dev channel); pass
#   https://registry.npmjs.org to fetch the public prod release instead.
#
# If GITHUB_OUTPUT is set (true in a GitHub Actions step), the resolved
# version is also written there as `ui_version`, for exactly that reuse.
